# CEO Briefing Skill

## Overview
The CEO Briefing skill generates an autonomous "Monday Morning CEO Briefing" report every Sunday night. It audits the week's activity — emails processed, tasks completed, social posts, invoices, and accounting — then writes a comprehensive briefing to `/Briefings/` in Obsidian.

## Capabilities
- Summarize weekly email and WhatsApp activity
- Count completed tasks from `/Done/` folder
- Pull revenue and invoice data from Odoo
- Identify bottlenecks (tasks that took too long)
- List upcoming deadlines
- Generate proactive cost optimization suggestions
- Write Monday Morning CEO Briefing to `/Briefings/`
- Update Dashboard.md with briefing summary

## Technical Implementation
- Triggered every Sunday at 11:00 PM via PM2 scheduler or cron
- Reads: `/Done/`, `/Logs/`, `/Plans/`, `Business_Goals.md`
- Calls Odoo MCP (localhost:3006) for financial data
- Writes output to: `/Briefings/YYYY-MM-DD_Monday_Briefing.md`
- Updates `Dashboard.md` Recent Activity section
- Script: part of `orchestrator.py` weekly audit function

## Input Parameters
- No manual input required — runs automatically
- Reads from `Business_Goals.md` for targets and KPIs
- Reads from `/Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json` for activity data
- Reads from Odoo MCP for financial metrics

## Activation Triggers
- Scheduled: Every Sunday 11:00 PM (cron / PM2 scheduler)
- Manual: Run orchestrator with `--briefing` flag
- Manual Claude invocation: `/ceo-briefing`

## Dependencies
- `/Done/` folder with weekly completed tasks
- `/Logs/` with JSON activity logs
- `Business_Goals.md` with targets and KPIs
- Odoo MCP running on port 3006 for financial data
- `/Briefings/` folder (created if not exists)

## Security Considerations
- Briefing contains business data — stays in local vault only
- Financial figures from Odoo — never shared externally
- Briefing file not synced to cloud (local-only document)

## Integration Points
- Reads Odoo data via `/api/accounting` or direct MCP call
- Updates Dashboard.md with briefing link
- Briefing visible in Obsidian vault under `/Briefings/`
- Logs briefing generation to `/Logs/`

## Error Handling
- Odoo unavailable → briefing generated with "Financial data unavailable" note
- No tasks in `/Done/` → reports "No tasks completed this week"
- `Business_Goals.md` missing → uses default targets
- Generation error → logs error, attempts simplified briefing

## Business_Goals.md Required Format
```markdown
## Q1 2026 Objectives
### Revenue Target
- Monthly goal: $[amount]
### Key Metrics
| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Response time | < 24h | > 48h |
| Invoice payment rate | > 90% | < 80% |
```
