- Monitor Oracle Cloud VM free tier limits (1 instance, 1GB RAM)

### Upcoming Deadlines
- **Hackathon submission** — Submit form: https://forms.gle/JR9T1SJq5rmQyGkGA
- **Twitter credits** — Reset March 1, 2026 → resume full social posting
- **LinkedIn token** — Activate once account is mature

### Next Week Goals
- Submit hackathon form with GitHub + Vercel links
- Record and upload demo video (5-10 minutes)
- Fix Gmail watcher Unicode issue
- Get LinkedIn token and activate posting
